\subsection{A Compact Subspace of Sequences of Non-negative Integers}

Here we consider a compact sub-space of a metric-space topology defined on the space of sequences of
non-negative integers. Both this metric space and sub-space are considered in \cite{federer} in relation to
Suslin sets. 

\subsection*{The Setup}

Let \(d_0(i, j)\) be the following bounded metric on the set of non-negative integers \(\mathbb Z_{\geq 0} = \{ 
0, 1, 2, ...\}\): 
\begin{equation}
d_0(i, j) \coloneqq \frac{|i -j|}{1 + |i - j|}.
\end{equation}
Note that \(d_0\) satisfies all of the conditions of being a metric, and that \(d(i, j) < 1\).

We let \(\mathcal N\) be the metric space of sequences of non-negative integers with following metric:
\begin{equation}
d(m, n) = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^\infty \frac{ d_0(m_i, n_i) } {2^i},
\end{equation}
for \(m, n \in \mathcal N\).

The importance of the space \(\mathcal N\) is that it is used to create the notion of Suslin sets which are
useful for studying the behavior of Borel sets under continuous maps \cite{federer}; these are topics
that are well beyond these notes and are not necessary for this example. We only mention them to provide
some context for \(\mathcal N\).
