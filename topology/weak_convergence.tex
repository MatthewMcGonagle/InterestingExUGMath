\subsection{Example of Weak Convergence that is not Metrizable}

In this example we explore a normed vector space where weak convergence of its continuous linear functionals
is not given by a metric. 

\subsubsection*{The Setup}

Let \(V\) be the space of \(\mathbb R\) valued sequences \(v_i\) such that \(v_i \neq 0\) for at most a finite
number of \(i\); we give \(V\) the \(l^\infty\) norm where \(\|v\|_{l^\infty} = \sup_i |v_i|\). For example,
\( (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...) \in V\), but \((1, 1, 1, 1, ...)\not\in V\). 

Let \(V^*\) be the space of continuous linear functionals on \(V\) with respect to the \(l^\infty\) norm; i.e.
the linear functions \(\omega : V \to \mathbb R\) that satisfy the usual continuity condition
\(|\omega(v)| \leq C_\omega \|v\|_{l^\infty}\). 

A sequence \(\omega_n \in V^*\) is said to converge weakly to \(\psi \in V^*\) when for any fixed vector
\(v \in V\) we have that \(\omega_n(v) \to \psi(v)\). 

We wish to show that there is no metric \(d\) on \(V^*\) such that weak convergence on \(V^*\) is equivalent to
convergence with respect to the metric \(d\); therefore, weak convergence properly belongs to the notion
of convergence with respect to topology and not metric spaces. Note that weak convergence is covered by the
topology generated by sets \(U_{\psi, v, \delta}\) of the form
\(U_{\psi, v, \delta} \coloneq \{\omega \in V^* \mid |\omega(v) - \psi(v)| < \delta\}\). That is, it is
covered by the topology
generated by a family of semi-norms. 

To show our desired conclusion, let \(d\) be any metric on \(V^*\) such that if 
\(d(\omega_n, \psi) \to 0\) then \(\omega_n\) weakly converges to \(\psi\). We will show that there must
exist a sequence \(\omega_n\) weakly converging to \(0\), but \(\omega_n\) does not converge to \(0\) with
respect to the metric \(d\). 

\subsubsection*{The Problem}

Given a metric \(d\) on \(V^*\) such that if \(d(\omega_n, \psi) \to 0\) then \(\omega_n\) weakly converges
to \(\psi\). Show that there must exist a sequence \(\omega_n\) weakly converging to \(0\), but \(\omega_n\)
does not converge to \(0\) with respect to \(d\). 

\subsubsection*{The Solution}

For any index \(i \in \mathcal N\), let \(1_i \coloneq v \in V\) such that \(v_i = 1\) and \(v_j = 0\) for
\(j \neq i\).

Consider any finite subset \(S \subset \mathcal N\). We let \(\delta(S)\) be the infimum of all
\(d(\omega, 0)\) such that \(\omega(1_i) \geq 1\) for some \(i \in S\).

We claim that \(\delta(S) > 0\). Since \(S\) is finite, there exists \(i \in S\) and a sequence \(\omega_n\)
such that \(d(\omega_n, 0) \to \delta(S)\) and \(\omega_n(1_i) \geq 1\).
