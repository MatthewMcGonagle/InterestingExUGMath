# Interesting Examples in Undergraduate Math

These are notes on interesting examples of mathematics at the undergraduate level. What makes an example interesting
is subjective, but these notes include examples that are considered interesting based on applications, theory,
historical significance, or technicality. Of course, examples can be a mixture of these ideas.

The examples are roughly split across different subject areas that are commonly split as individual classes in
undergraduate education; however, there are examples that require more than one subject, and where to correctly
place them is a bit ambiguous.
